Metafacture is a toolkit for processing semi-structured data with a focus on library metadata. It provides a versatile set of tools for reading, writing and transforming data. Metafacture can be used as a stand-alone application or as a Java library in other applications. The name Metafacture is a portmanteau of the words *meta*data and manu*facture*.

Metafacture includes a [large number of modules](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-documentation/blob/master/flux-commands.md) for operating on semi-structured data. These modules can be combined to build pipelines to perform complex metadata processing tasks. The pipelines can be constructed either in Java code or with the domain-specific language **Flux**. One of the core features of Metafacture is the **Metamorph** module. Metamorph is an xml-based language for specifying transformations of semi-structured data. It can be seamlessly integrated into Java code.

At its heart Metafacture is a framework for implementing modules for metadata processing. This makes Metafacture easily extendable with additional modules. The [plugins and tools page](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-core/wiki/Plugins-and-Tools) on the wiki shows supplementary packages and projects which extend Metafacture.

Originally, Metafacture was developed as part of the [Culturegraph](http://culturegraph.org) platform but it is developed independently now and used by others, too: [see who uses Metafacture](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-core/wiki/Who-uses-Metafacture).

# Getting started

You can either use Metafacture as a stand-alone application or include it as a Java library in your own projects.

## Metafacture as a stand-alone application

If you are only interested in running Flux scripts without doing any Java programming this is the way to go. The instructions assume that you are using a *nix-like shell. [See more information in the wiki page about Flux](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-core/wiki/Flux-user-guide).

1. Download the latest distribution package from the [metafacture-core/releases](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-core/releases) page. Make sure that you do download a distribution package and _not_ a source code package (the file name should include *-dist*).

2. Extract the downloaded archive:
   ```bash
   $ tar xzf metafacture-core-VERSION-dist.tar.gz
   ```
   This will create a new directory containing a ready-to-use metafacture distribution.
3. Change into the newly created directory:
   ```bash
   $ cd metafacture-core-VERSION
   ```
4. Run one of the example scripts:
   ```bash
   $ ./flux.sh examples/read/marc21/read-marc21.flux
   ```
   This example will print a number of marc21 records on standard out.

The _examples_ folder contains many more examples which provide a good starting point for learning metafacture.

## Using Metafacture as a Java libary

If you want use Metafacture in your own Java projects all you need to add some dependencies to your project. As of Metafacture 5 the single metafacture-core package has been replaced with a number of domain-specific packages. You can find the list of packages on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.metafacture%22).

Alternatively, you can simply guess the package names from the top-level folders in the source code repository -- they are the same. For instance, if you want to use Metamorph in your project, simply add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.metafacture</groupId>
    <artifactId>metamorph</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

or if Gradle is your build tool of choice use:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.metafacture:metamorph:VERSION'
}
```

Our integration server automatically publishes successful builds of all branches as snapshot versions on [Sonatype OSS Repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/index.html#nexus-search;quick~metafacture). The version number is derived from the branch name. Snapshot builds from the master branch always have the version "master-SNAPSHOT".

## Building metafacture-core from source

Building metafacture-core from source is easy. All you need is git and JDK 8:

1. Clone the metafacture-core repository and change into the directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-core.git
$ cd metafacture-core
```

2. Invoke the gradle-wrapper to download Gradle and build metafacture-core (on Windows call `gradlew.bat install`):

```bash
$ ./gradlew install
```

Besides the resulting distribution in `metafacture-core/metafacture-runner/build/distributions/` this also provides builds in your local maven repository.


See [Code Quality and Style](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-core/wiki/Code-Quality-and-Style) on the wiki for further information on the sources.
